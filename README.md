# Fishbone Component

A custom canvas component which supports pan and zoom, along with a Fishbone component that renders within the Canvas for doing root cause analysis.

May use this in a Root cause tool im building in another project. Mostly wanted to tackle building a canvas which supports zoom, drag and pan.

The leaning here was to build using composition and react context to make the component flexible.
