# React Canvas

A custom canvas component built to be reusable in some of my projects, which supports an infinate canvas with pan and zoom. Currently still a work in progress.

The component is built using composition and react context. Currently working on adding shapes to the toolbar which can be rendered on the canvas and resized/moved around, similar to tools like Miro.

I also want to implement support to allow for registering custom shapes to the canvas easily from outside of the component.
