# React Canvas

A reusable custom canvas component designed for use across multiple projects. It provides an infinite canvas with smooth pan and zoom support and is built using React composition patterns and context for flexibility and extensibility.

The project is currently a work in progress. Ongoing development includes adding shapes that can be rendered on the canvas and interactively moved and resized, inspired by tools like Miro.

Planned features also include a public API for registering custom shapes externally, allowing consumers of the component to extend the canvas with their own shape implementations without modifying core code.
